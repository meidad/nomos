# Assistant

A TypeScript CLI and multi-channel AI assistant built on top of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) via the `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. It inherits all of Claude Code's built-in capabilities -- Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, agent loop, compaction, streaming -- and layers on persistent sessions, a vector memory system, a daemon with channel integrations, scheduled tasks, 25 bundled skills, and deep personalization.

## Features

- **Interactive CLI** with ink-based TUI, streaming markdown rendering, gradient spinner, and Catppuccin Mocha color theme
- **Daemon mode** -- long-running background process with WebSocket API, message queue, and multi-channel gateway
- **Channel integrations** -- Slack, Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp adapters with per-channel session scoping
- **Slack User Mode** -- act as the authenticated user: drafts responses to your DMs and @mentions for approval, then sends them as you
- **Cron / scheduled tasks** -- run prompts on a schedule with configurable session targets and delivery modes
- **25 bundled skills** -- domain-specific instructions injected into the system prompt (GitHub, weather, Google Workspace, Slack, Discord, PDF, PPTX, XLSX, and more)
- **Vector memory** -- PostgreSQL + pgvector hybrid search (vector similarity + full-text search with RRF fusion)
- **Automatic conversation memory** -- every daemon conversation turn is indexed into vector memory, enabling cross-session and cross-channel recall
- **Session persistence** -- all conversations stored in PostgreSQL with SDK session resume and auto-compaction
- **Personalization** -- user profile, agent identity, SOUL.md personality, TOOLS.md environment config, per-agent configs
- **First-run wizard** -- interactive setup for database, API keys, and model selection when no `.env` exists
- **Security** -- tool execution approval for dangerous operations, configurable approval policies, `/doctor` security audit
- **Pairing system** -- 8-character pairing codes with TTL for channel access control and DM policies
- **Conversation scoping** -- per-sender, per-peer, per-channel, or per-channel-peer session isolation
- **MCP server support** -- external MCP servers via config file plus in-process `memory_search` tool
- **Model switching** -- pick between Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku mid-session; configurable thinking levels
- **Proactive messaging** -- send outbound messages to any channel outside the reply flow

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start a PostgreSQL database with pgvector
docker run -d \
  --name assistant-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=assistant \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=assistant \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=assistant \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg17

# 2. Set up environment
cd assistant
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set DATABASE_URL and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or Vertex AI credentials)

# 3. Install and run
pnpm install
pnpm dev -- db migrate
pnpm dev -- chat
```

The first-run wizard will guide you through setup if no `.env` file is detected.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22
- **pnpm** >= 10.23
- **PostgreSQL** with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension
- **Anthropic API key** or **Google Cloud credentials** (for Vertex AI)
- **Google Cloud credentials** for embeddings (uses `gemini-embedding-001` via Vertex AI)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd assistant
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your settings:

```bash
# --- Database (required) ---
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://assistant:assistant@localhost:5432/assistant

# --- Provider (choose one) ---

# Option A: Anthropic direct API
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Option B: Vertex AI
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=my-project
CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5

# --- Model ---
ASSISTANT_MODEL=claude-opus-4-6
```

### 3. Set up the database

PostgreSQL must have the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension installed.

#### Option A: Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name assistant-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=assistant \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=assistant \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=assistant \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg17
```

Set in `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://assistant:assistant@localhost:5432/assistant
```

#### Option B: Local PostgreSQL (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install postgresql@17 pgvector
brew services start postgresql@17
createdb assistant
psql assistant -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
```

### 4. Run migrations

```bash
pnpm dev -- db migrate
```

### 5. (Vertex AI only) Authenticate

If using Vertex AI for Claude and/or embeddings:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Usage

### Chat sessions

```bash
# Start an interactive chat
pnpm dev -- chat

# Specify a model
pnpm dev -- chat -m claude-sonnet-4-6

# Resume a previous session by key
pnpm dev -- chat -s my-project

# Force a fresh session (skip resume)
pnpm dev -- chat --fresh
```

### Production mode

```bash
pnpm build
node dist/index.js chat
```

### Daemon management

```bash
assistant daemon start              # Start daemon in background
assistant daemon start -p 9000      # Start on a custom port
assistant daemon stop               # Stop the running daemon
assistant daemon restart             # Restart the daemon
assistant daemon status              # Show daemon PID and status
assistant daemon logs                # Tail the last 50 lines of logs
assistant daemon logs -n 200         # Tail more lines
assistant daemon run                 # Run daemon in foreground (dev mode)
```

### Memory commands

```bash
# Index a single file into the vector store
pnpm dev -- memory add ./src/ui/repl.ts

# Index an entire directory recursively
pnpm dev -- memory add ./src

# Search the memory store
pnpm dev -- memory search "how does session persistence work"

# List indexed sources
pnpm dev -- memory list

# Clear all memory
pnpm dev -- memory clear
```

### Config commands

```bash
pnpm dev -- config list             # List all config values
pnpm dev -- config set <key> <val>  # Set a config value
pnpm dev -- config get <key>        # Get a config value
```

### Session management

```bash
pnpm dev -- session list            # List recent sessions
pnpm dev -- session archive <id>    # Archive a session
pnpm dev -- session delete <id>     # Delete a session
```

## Daemon Mode

The daemon is a long-running background process that turns the assistant into a multi-channel AI gateway. It boots an agent runtime, a WebSocket server, channel adapters, and a cron engine -- then processes incoming messages from all sources through a per-session message queue.

### Architecture

```
                         +-------------------+
                         |     Gateway       |
                         | (orchestrator)    |
                         +--------+----------+
                                  |
            +---------------------+---------------------+
            |                     |                     |
   +--------v--------+  +--------v--------+  +---------v--------+
   |  WebSocket       |  |  Channel        |  |  Cron            |
   |  Server          |  |  Manager        |  |  Engine          |

   +--------+---------+  +--------+--------+  +---------+--------+
            |                     |                      |
            +---------------------+----------------------+
                                  |
                         +--------v---------+
                         |  Message Queue   |
                         |  (per-session    |
                         |   FIFO)          |
                         +--------+---------+
                                  |
                         +--------v---------+
                         |  Agent Runtime   |
                         |  (Claude SDK)    |
                         +------------------+
```

### How it works

1. **Gateway** boots all subsystems and installs signal handlers for graceful shutdown.
2. **Channel adapters** register automatically based on which environment variables are present (e.g., `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` enables the Slack adapter).
3. **Message queue** serializes messages per session key -- concurrent messages to the same conversation are processed sequentially; messages for different sessions process in parallel.
4. **Agent runtime** loads config, profile, identity, skills, and MCP servers once at startup, then processes each message through the Claude Agent SDK.
5. **WebSocket server** accepts connections from terminal UI clients and streams agent events back in real time.

### Starting the daemon

```bash
# Background mode
assistant daemon start

# Development mode (foreground with logs)
assistant daemon run
```

The daemon writes a PID file to `~/.assistant/daemon.pid` and logs to `~/.assistant/daemon.log`.

## Channel Integrations

Each channel adapter is automatically registered when its required environment variables are present. No additional configuration is needed beyond setting the tokens. For detailed setup guides with screenshots and step-by-step instructions, see the [docs/integrations/](docs/integrations/) directory.

### Slack

Requires Socket Mode (for real-time events without a public URL).

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...          # Bot User OAuth Token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...          # App-Level Token (Socket Mode)
SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS=C123,C456  # Optional: restrict to specific channels
```

Responds to `@mentions` and direct messages. Supports threaded conversations with `thread_ts` routing.

#### Slack User Mode

User Mode lets the assistant act **as you** rather than as a bot. It listens to DMs and @mentions directed at your personal Slack account, generates draft responses, and waits for your approval before sending them with your user token.

```bash
SLACK_USER_TOKEN=xoxp-...          # User OAuth Token (in addition to bot tokens above)
```

When enabled, both adapters run simultaneously. Drafts can be approved via CLI (`/approve <id>`) or by clicking Approve/Reject buttons in a bot DM. See [docs/integrations/slack-user-mode.md](docs/integrations/slack-user-mode.md) for the full setup guide including required OAuth scopes and event subscriptions.

### Discord

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...                     # Bot token from Discord Developer Portal
DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNELS=123456,789012    # Optional: restrict to specific channels
DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILDS=111222             # Optional: restrict to specific servers
```

Responds to `@mentions` and DMs. Supports per-channel sessions and thread routing.

### Telegram

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...                    # Token from @BotFather
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS=123456,-789012     # Optional: restrict to specific chats
```

Uses grammY with long polling. Responds to all messages in private chats; requires `@mention` in group chats. Supports typing indicators and message chunking.

### WhatsApp

```bash
WHATSAPP_ENABLED=true
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_CHATS=15551234567@s.whatsapp.net,120363123456789012@g.us
```

Uses the Baileys library with QR code authentication (no Meta Business API required). On first start, a QR code is displayed in the terminal for pairing. Auth state is persisted to `~/.assistant/whatsapp-auth/`.

## Cron and Scheduled Tasks

The cron engine runs scheduled prompts through the agent runtime. Jobs are stored in the database and managed through the daemon.

### Schedule types

| Type    | Format               | Example                |
| ------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `at`    | ISO 8601 datetime    | `2025-06-15T09:00:00Z` |
| `every` | Interval string      | `30m`, `2h`, `1d`      |
| `cron`  | Standard cron syntax | `0 9 * * 1-5`          |

### Session targets

| Target     | Behavior                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `main`     | Reuses a persistent session keyed by job ID |
| `isolated` | Creates a fresh session for each execution  |

### Delivery modes

| Mode       | Behavior                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `none`     | Result is stored but not delivered       |
| `announce` | Result is sent to the configured channel |

Jobs track error counts and can be auto-disabled after repeated failures.

## Skills System

Skills are markdown files (`SKILL.md`) with YAML frontmatter that provide domain-specific instructions to the agent. Their content is injected into the system prompt at session start.

### Three-tier loading

Skills are loaded from three locations, in order:

1. **Bundled** -- `assistant/skills/` (shipped with the project)
2. **Personal** -- `~/.assistant/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. **Project** -- `./skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

### Bundled skills

The following 25 skills are included:

### Creating a custom skill

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.assistant/skills/my-skill
cat > ~/.assistant/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-skill
description: "What this skill does"
emoji: "🔧"
requires:
  bins: [jq]
  os: [darwin, linux]
install:
  - brew install jq
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent when this skill is active...
EOF
```

Skills support metadata fields for `requires` (binary and OS dependencies), `install` (installation commands), and `emoji` (display icon).

### Skill creator

The bundled `skill-creator` skill enables the agent to create new skills on your behalf via conversation. Ask the agent to create a skill and it will generate the SKILL.md file with proper frontmatter.

## Memory System

The memory system uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for hybrid retrieval that combines vector similarity search with full-text search, fused using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

### How it works

- **Embeddings** are generated using Google's `gemini-embedding-001` model (768 dimensions) through Vertex AI
- **Chunking** splits documents into overlapping text segments for indexing
- **Hybrid search** runs both vector cosine similarity and PostgreSQL full-text search, then merges results with RRF scoring
- **FTS fallback** is used when embedding generation is unavailable
- **Automatic conversation indexing** -- every daemon conversation turn is automatically chunked, embedded, and stored in memory, enabling cross-session and cross-channel recall

### Automatic conversation indexing

When the daemon processes a message, the user's input and the agent's response are automatically indexed into the memory store after delivery. This runs asynchronously (fire-and-forget) so it never delays message delivery.

- Stored with source `"conversation"` and path set to the session key (e.g., `slack:C01ABC123`)
- Works across all channels -- Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, and CLI via WebSocket
- Falls back to text-only indexing (full-text search) when embeddings are unavailable
- `assistant memory list` shows conversation memory alongside manually indexed files
- `assistant memory clear -s conversation` clears only conversation memory

### Agent integration

The agent has access to a `memory_search` MCP tool and can query the vector store automatically during conversations. At the start of each session, the agent proactively searches memory for context about the user and their projects. Automatically indexed conversations appear in search results, enabling the agent to recall past interactions regardless of which channel or session they occurred in.

### CLI commands

```bash
pnpm dev -- memory add ./path/to/file      # Index a file
pnpm dev -- memory add ./path/to/directory  # Index a directory recursively
pnpm dev -- memory search "query text"      # Search the store
pnpm dev -- memory list                     # List indexed sources
pnpm dev -- memory clear                    # Clear all memory
pnpm dev -- memory clear -s conversation    # Clear only conversation memory
```

## Personalization

### User profile

Set your profile to receive personalized responses. Profile values are stored in the database config table and appended to the system prompt.

```bash
# Inside the REPL:
/profile set name Alice
/profile set timezone America/New_York
/profile set workspace "Building a React dashboard"
/profile set instructions "Always respond concisely"
```

### Agent identity

Customize how the agent presents itself:

```bash
/identity set name Jarvis
/identity set emoji 🤖
```

### SOUL.md

A personality file that shapes the agent's tone and behavior. Place it at:

- `./.assistant/SOUL.md` (project-local, takes priority)
- `~/.assistant/SOUL.md` (global)

The content is injected into the system prompt under a "Personality" section.

### TOOLS.md

An environment configuration file that tells the agent about available tools and environment details. Same search paths as SOUL.md:

- `./.assistant/TOOLS.md` (project-local)
- `~/.assistant/TOOLS.md` (global)

### Per-agent configs

Define multiple agent personalities in `agents.json`. Switch between them with `/agent <id>` in the REPL. Each agent can have its own model, thinking level, and system prompt instructions.

### First-run bootstrap

On first launch, if no `.env` file exists, an interactive setup wizard walks through:

1. Database connection (DATABASE_URL)
2. API provider selection (Anthropic direct or Vertex AI)
3. API key or Google Cloud project configuration
4. Model selection

## Slash Commands

All commands are available inside the REPL during a chat session.

## MCP Servers

Add external MCP servers by creating `.assistant/mcp.json` in your project or home directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./path/to/mcp-server.js"]
    },
    "remote-server": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

These are passed directly to the Claude Agent SDK alongside the built-in `assistant-memory` MCP server, which exposes the `memory_search` tool.

## WebSocket Protocol

When the daemon is running, terminal UI clients and custom integrations communicate via WebSocket on `ws://localhost:8765` (configurable with `-p`).

### Client messages (client to server)

```typescript
// Send a user message
{ type: "message", content: "Hello", sessionKey: "my-session" }

// Run a slash command
{ type: "command", command: "/status", sessionKey: "my-session" }

// Approve a pending draft (Slack User Mode)
{ type: "approve_draft", draftId: "uuid-string" }

// Reject a pending draft (Slack User Mode)
{ type: "reject_draft", draftId: "uuid-string" }

// Keep-alive ping
{ type: "ping" }
```

### Server events (server to client)

```typescript
// Streamed SDK events (text chunks, tool use, thinking, etc.)
{ type: "stream_event", event: SDKMessage }

// Tool execution summary
{ type: "tool_use_summary", tool_name: "Bash", summary: "Running tests" }

// Final result with usage stats
{ type: "result", result: [...], usage: { input_tokens: 1234, output_tokens: 567 }, total_cost_usd: 0.05, session_id: "..." }

// System notifications (including draft events: draft_created, draft_approved, draft_rejected)
{ type: "system", subtype: "info", message: "Session resumed", data: {} }

// Error messages
{ type: "error", message: "Something went wrong" }

// Pong response to ping
{ type: "pong" }
```

The server maintains heartbeat checks every 30 seconds and terminates unresponsive connections.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev                # Run in dev mode (tsx, no build needed)
pnpm build              # Build with tsdown -> dist/index.js
pnpm typecheck          # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)
pnpm test               # Run tests (vitest)
pnpm test:watch         # Tests in watch mode
pnpm lint               # Lint (oxlint)
pnpm lint:fix           # Lint fix + format
pnpm format             # Format (oxfmt)
pnpm format:check       # Check formatting
pnpm check              # Full check (format + typecheck + lint)
pnpm daemon:dev         # Run daemon in dev mode (tsx)
```

## Architecture

```
User input --> REPL (src/ui/repl.ts)
  --> SDK query() with model, permissions, system prompt
  --> MCP servers: external (from mcp.json) + in-process (memory_search)
  --> Iterate SDK messages --> render to terminal + persist to PostgreSQL

Daemon mode:
  Channel message --> Channel Adapter --> Message Queue
    --> Agent Runtime (SDK query) --> Response --> Channel Adapter --> Platform
```
