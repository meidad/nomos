# Slack Integration

Connect Nomos to Slack so it can respond to DMs and @mentions in channels. Messages stream in real-time — users see a "_Thinking..._" indicator followed by progressive text updates, just like ChatGPT's Slack bot.

## Prerequisites

- A Slack workspace where you have permission to install apps
- The Nomos daemon running (`pnpm daemon:dev` or `nomos daemon start`)

## Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App** > **From scratch**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Nomos") and select your workspace
4. Click **Create App**

## Step 2: Enable Socket Mode

Socket Mode lets the bot connect without exposing a public URL.

1. In the app settings sidebar, go to **Socket Mode**
2. Toggle **Enable Socket Mode** to On
3. You'll be prompted to create an App-Level Token:
   - Name it `socket-token`
   - Add the scope `connections:write`
   - Click **Generate**
4. Copy the token (starts with `xapp-`) — this is your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`

## Step 3: Configure Bot Scopes

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** in the sidebar
2. Scroll to **Scopes** > **Bot Token Scopes**
3. Add the following scopes:

| Scope              | Purpose                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `chat:write`       | Send and update messages          |
| `channels:read`    | List public channels              |
| `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels  |
| `groups:read`      | List private channels             |
| `groups:history`   | Read messages in private channels |
| `im:history`       | Read direct messages              |
| `im:read`          | View DM metadata                  |
| `im:write`         | Send direct messages              |
| `users:read`       | Look up user names and details    |
| `reactions:write`  | Add emoji reactions               |
| `pins:write`       | Pin and unpin messages            |
| `files:write`      | Upload files                      |
| `search:read`      | Search workspace messages         |

## Step 4: Enable App Home & Direct Messages

This step is required for users to DM the bot. Without it, Slack shows "Sending messages to this app has been turned off."

1. Go to **App Home** in the sidebar
2. Scroll to **Show Tabs**
3. Check **Messages Tab**
4. Enable the checkbox **"Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"**

## Step 5: Enable Event Subscriptions

1. Go to **Event Subscriptions** in the sidebar
2. Toggle **Enable Events** to On
3. Under **Subscribe to bot events**, add:
   - `app_mention` — triggers when the bot is @mentioned in a channel
   - `message.im` — triggers on direct messages to the bot
4. Click **Save Changes**

## Step 6: Install the App

After configuring scopes, App Home, and events, install (or reinstall) the app to apply the changes.

1. Go to **Install App** in the sidebar
2. Click **Install to Workspace** (or **Reinstall to Workspace** if already installed)
3. Review the permissions and click **Allow**
4. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`) — this is your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

> **Important:** Any time you change scopes, events, or App Home settings, you must reinstall the app for the changes to take effect.

## Step 7: Configure Environment Variables

Add the tokens to your `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here
```

### Optional: Restrict to Specific Channels

To limit the bot to certain channels, set a comma-separated list of channel IDs:

```bash
SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS=C01ABC123,C02DEF456
```

To find a channel ID: right-click a channel in Slack > **View channel details** > the ID is at the bottom of the popup.

## Step 7: Start the Daemon

```bash
# Development mode (foreground with logs)
pnpm daemon:dev

# Or production mode (background)
nomos daemon start
```

You should see output confirming the Slack adapter started:

```
[slack-adapter] Running (bot: U0XXXXXX)
[gateway]   Channels: slack
```

## Usage

### Direct Messages

Send a DM to the bot — it responds to all messages in DMs automatically.

### Channel Mentions

In any channel the bot has been invited to, @mention it:

```
@Nomos what's the weather like today?
```

The bot must be invited to a channel before it can receive mentions there. Type `/invite @Nomos` in the channel.

### Threaded Conversations

All replies are posted in-thread. The bot maintains conversation context within each thread.

## Real-Time Streaming

When the bot processes a message in Slack:

1. A "_Thinking..._" placeholder appears immediately
2. As the agent generates text, the message updates every ~1.5 seconds
3. During tool use, you'll see indicators like "_Using Read..._"
4. The final complete response replaces the streaming content

For long responses (over 4,000 characters), the streaming message is replaced with properly chunked messages.

## MCP Tools

When `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is set, the agent also gets access to Slack MCP tools for proactive actions:

| Tool                   | Description                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `slack_send_message`   | Send messages to any channel or thread |
| `slack_edit_message`   | Edit previously sent messages          |
| `slack_delete_message` | Delete messages                        |
| `slack_read_channel`   | Read recent messages (up to 100)       |
| `slack_read_thread`    | Read thread replies                    |
| `slack_react`          | Add emoji reactions                    |
| `slack_pin_message`    | Pin a message                          |
| `slack_unpin_message`  | Unpin a message                        |
| `slack_list_pins`      | List pinned items in a channel         |
| `slack_list_channels`  | List accessible channels               |
| `slack_user_info`      | Look up user details                   |
| `slack_upload_file`    | Upload files to channels               |
| `slack_search`         | Search workspace messages              |

These tools let the agent interact with Slack beyond just replying — it can search history, read other channels, pin important messages, and more.

## Troubleshooting

### "Sending messages to this app has been turned off"

This means the Messages Tab isn't enabled for the bot:

1. Go to your app settings > **App Home** > **Show Tabs**
2. Check **Messages Tab**
3. Enable **"Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"**
4. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** and confirm the `im:history`, `im:read`, and `im:write` scopes are added
5. Go to **Event Subscriptions** > **Subscribe to bot events** and confirm `message.im` is listed
6. **Reinstall the app** — go to **Install App** and click **Reinstall to Workspace**

All of these must be in place, and the app must be reinstalled after making changes.

### Bot doesn't respond to messages

- Verify both `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` are set correctly
- Check the daemon logs for connection errors
- Make sure `message.im` and `app_mention` events are subscribed
- For channel messages, ensure the bot is invited to the channel

### "not_in_channel" errors

The bot needs to be a member of any channel it posts to. Invite it with `/invite @Nomos`.

### Rate limiting

The streaming responder throttles updates to ~40/minute per conversation, well within Slack's Tier 3 limit of 50 requests/minute. If you see rate limit errors in logs, they're handled gracefully — the update is skipped and retried on the next interval.

### Socket Mode disconnections

Socket Mode automatically reconnects. If the bot appears offline, check:

- The `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` hasn't been revoked
- The app's Socket Mode setting is still enabled
- The daemon process is running (`nomos daemon status`)

## Slack User Mode

In addition to bot mode, Nomos supports **User Mode** — where it acts as you (the authenticated user) instead of as a bot. It listens to DMs and @mentions directed at your personal Slack account, drafts responses for your approval, and sends them using your user token so they appear as if you typed them.

For full setup instructions, see [Slack User Mode](slack-user-mode.md).
